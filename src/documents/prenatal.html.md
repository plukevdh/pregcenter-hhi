# Prenatal Care

### I might be pregnant. Now what?

1. Come see us! Our services are completely free, and you can either walk in or call 689-2222 to make an appointment.

2. At your first visit, we will discuss your medical history with you. We come under HIPAA, therefore, all information is absolutely confidential.

3. We will then verify your pregnancy through a urine test, offer a test for sexually-transmitted infections, and provide counsel. If required, we will do an ultrasound exam to confirm the pregnancy, determine gestational age, viability and location.

4. If positive, we’ll discuss all your options, including pros and cons of each choice. Go to the Adoption page to see some of your options. We’ll discuss all of the services we have available to help you - see the Home page for Services and Descriptions.

5. We’d love to help you determine your probable due date, monitor progress of mother and baby as accurately as possible through our free prenatal service available through the 16th week of gestation. Estimation of your due date can be determined via date of last menstrual period or ultrasound.

6. This first visit may take up to an hour; however, subsequent visits will probably be shorter. After the 16th week, we will transition you for further care to another service provider.
