Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) Epidemic

* A minimum of sixty-five million Americans have an incurable sexually-transmitted infection.
* Almost 1,000,000 Americans have HIV and 20% do not know they have the disease.
* South Carolina ranks 8th in the nation in men and 9th in women in the number of new AIDS cases per capita.
* South Carolina ranks #7 in the United States for Chlamydia in women.
* Chlamydia is the #1 cause of blindness in kids.
* South Carolina ranks #12 in the nation for infectious Syphilis.
* While condoms can reduce the risk for some STI’s, in no case is it 100% effective in preventing any infections – and for some illnesses such as HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) there is no conclusive evidence that condoms are effective at reducing transmission of the virus at all.
* South Carolina ranks #3 in the per capita number of new cases of Gonorrhea.
* Some of the worst side effects of STI’s are not physical. Teenage boys who are sexually active are 5 times more likely to attempt suicide than boys who are abstinent. Teenage girls are almost 3 times as likely to try to kill themselves than their abstinent counterparts.
