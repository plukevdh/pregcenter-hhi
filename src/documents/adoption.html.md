# Adoption

### Questions You May Have

1. **Is adoption the right choice for you and for your child?** How can you make a plan that will meet your needs and that of your child? We've put together some questions that can help you as you plan for both futures. The list isnâ€™t exhaustive, but it can get you started in the right direction.

2. **How can adoption be a good choice for my baby and me?** There are so many reasons why you may not be able to parent your child. It may involve emotions, finances, work (or lack of), secure home, school and many others. However, you can still provide a loving home for your baby through choosing adoption.

3. **Can I choose the family for my baby?** Yes! All of the agencies to whom we refer have many couples who have been studied and approved. You might also opt to go through a state agency or local attorney. The choice is yours.

1. **How much contact can I have with my baby after the birth and/or adoption?** You can spend as much time with your baby at the hospital as you choose. When you are planning the adoption, you can choose an open adoption plan that allows visitation, or a more restrictive plan that keeps you informed through letters and photos. If you prefer no contact, confidential adoption is also possible.

1. **How soon after birth can my baby go to the parents I choose?** The timing of your child's placement depends upon your preference, legal aspects, and the role of the birth father. Many mothers want their babies placed with the adoptive family directly from the hospital, while others choose interim care while they consider their adoption decision.

1. **How much will my child know about me?** Regardless of the type of adoption plan, you will want to provide a thorough social and medical history for your child. If you develop an adoption plan that includes ongoing contact, your child will have personal knowledge and contact.

1. **Does the expectant father have any rights?** Both you and the expectant father have rights. If you disagree about adoption or you no longer have a relationship with him, your agency will work with him and/or the courts to determine his rights.

1. **Can my child find me if he or she wants to search someday?** Searching may only be necessary if there has not been ongoing contact. The law in your state determines when and how your child may access the information in the adoption file, which your caseworker can explain.

1. **How can I be sure that my child will be well cared for?** There are standards that every prospective adoptive family must meet which are set by both the agency and the state in which they live. Families are thoroughly assessed before being approved for adoption, and a caseworker will make visits to the adoptive family after placement to ensure your child's well-being.

1. **Do I need an attorney, or do I pay my agency to assist me with the adoption?** In many states, you will not need an attorney, and most agencies provide services to you at no cost. If you do need an attorney, usually those costs are paid by the adoptive family.

1. **Can I get help with medical and living expenses while I'm making an adoption plan?** Assistance with medical and living expenses may be available through the agencies. For details about how your agency can help you in your particular circumstances, contact your caseworker.
